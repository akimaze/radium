<h2>Sample player</h2>

The sample player plays audio files.
<UL>
  <LI>The Sample Player can load XI intruments; Soundfonts, and all types of sample formats supported by libsndfile.
  <LI>WAV files are looped if they have loops defined in the "sampl" chunk, or they have "Loop Start" and "Loop End" cue id's.
  <LI>SoundFonts (.sf2 files) often sound better when played with the FluidSynth instrument instead of the Sample Player. However, the Sample Player uses less memory, are faster to create, has sample-accurate note scheduling, supports pitch changes and polyphonic aftertouch (velocity can be changed while a note is playing), and has configurable options such as attack, decay, sustain, and release.
  <LI>There is currently no graphical sample editor to edit samples, a feature which traditionally are provided by trackers. This feature should be provided later though. Until then, external sample editors must be used instead, if needed.
  <LI>To record audio, either from outside the program or inside the program, click the red <font color="red">Record</font> button in the instrument widget header. A new audio file will be created automatically when recording. Recording will start when the new instrument receives a note, and it will stop recording when that note stops playing.
