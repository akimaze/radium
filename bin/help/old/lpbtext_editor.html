  <h2>LPB</h2>


  LPB stands for <b>L</b>ines <b>P</b>er <b>B</b>eat, and is used to specify how many tracker lines to play in one beat.
<p>
  In trackers, this value is often important since it sets the edit-resolution. But in Radium, it's more convenient to change the <A href="lztrack_editor_framed.html">LZ value</a> instead.
<p>
  LPB would in most situations be set to 4, and not changed afterwards.
  

  <h2>Default LPB</h2>

  The LPB text entry lets you set the default LPB. The LPB text entry is either placed in the upper left corner of the editor, or in the bottom bar:<br>

    <h2>LPB track</h2>
    
  The LPB track lets you override the default LPB for a block.
  
  <p>
    
    To enable the LPB track, right-click somewhere in the timing area of the editor (to the left of the note tracks), and enable "LPB".

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
      
 LPB format: <b>xx</b>, where xx goes between 1 and 99.
      
 Notes:
  * If <b>xx</b> has an 'm' prefix, it means that the line contains more than one LPB entry. The last LPB is displayed.
  * If <b>xx</b> has a 'd' prefix, it means that the LPB entry starts below the start of the line.
      
  </pre>
