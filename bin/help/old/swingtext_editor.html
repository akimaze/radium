  <h2>Swing</h2>

  The Swing tracks provide efficient ways to create swing.
<p>
    
  There are two types of swing tracks in the editor:
<OL>
  <LI>The global swing track.<br>
    <UL>
      <LI><b>Position:</b> To the right of the "LZ" track. (See first picture.)
      <LI><b>Task:</b> Apply swing to all tracks in a block.
    </UL>
  <LI>Swing subtracks.
    <UL>
      <LI><b>Position:</b> To the left of note text. (See second picture.)
      <LI><b>Task:</b> Apply swing to individual tracks, overriding the global swing track for that track.
      <LI><b>How to enable:</b> Right-click inside a track and enable "Swing text".
    </UL>
</OL>

<p>
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
Swing text entry format: <b>xxt</b>, where
    
<b>xx</b>  = Swing weight. <b>1</b> = lowest weight, <b>99</b> = highest weight.
<b>  t</b> = Whether to gradually change tempo between the current and the next swing weight.

If <b>t</b> is "<b> </b>" (empty), the change happens gradually.
If <b>t</b> is "<b>|</b>", the change happens immediately.

Press <b>T</b> to switch between the two modes.
  </pre>

  Tips:
  
<UL>
  <LI> Press DEL to remove a swing entry.
  <LI> To stop swing in the middle of a block, add "1" (or any number) to the first beat in a bar, and remove all other swing values from that bar.
  <LI> To disable all swing in a block (can be used to quickly compare swing vs. non-swing), unselect the check box below "Swing" in the upper left part of the editor.
  <LI> To adjust accelerando and deaccelerando behavior (relevant when <b>t</b> is empty), go to File -> Song properties.
  <LI> To change whether to let the editor graphics swing along while playing, go to File -> Song properties.
  <LI> To change whether to apply global swing to the tempo sent to plugins and JACK transport, go to File -> Song properties.
</UL>
