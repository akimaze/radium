  <h2>Signatures</h2>
  
  Signatures specify rhythm. It does so by specifying number of beats (in a bar) above beat type. For instance, a 4/4 signature means that there are 4 beats in the bar, and that each beat is a quarter.
  <p>
   Rhytm is used by external plugins, the metronome, modulators, and jack transport.
  <p>
    Here are some other common names for the term "signature": time signature, meter signature, meter, metre, measure, and measure signature. 
  <p>
  Example 1: If tempo is set to 64 BPM, and the signature is set to 8/8, a new bar will be played every 16 seconds (64/4 * 8/8), and a new beat will be played every 2 seconds (64/4 * 1/8). Example 2: If the signature is set to 2/4, a new bar will be played every 8 seconds (64/4 * 2/4), and a new beat will be played every 4 seconds (64/4 * 1/4).
  

  <h2>Default Signature</h2>

  The Signature text entry lets you set the default Signature. The Signature text entry is either placed in the upper left corner of the editor, or in the bottom bar:<br>

  <IMG SRC="globalsignature.png" ALT="Global Signature in the editor" style="border:10px solid transparent">
  <IMG SRC="globalsignature2.png" ALT="Global Signature in the bottom bar" style="border:10px solid transparent">
  <br>
  This entry is shown in the bottom bar if the signature track is hidden in the editor.
  
  <p>

    <h2>Signature track</h2>
    
  The Signature track lets you override the default Signature for a block.
  
  <p>
    
    To show the Signature track, right-click somewhere in the timing area of the editor (to the left of the note tracks), and enable "Signature".
