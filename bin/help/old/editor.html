Note that the editor was from the start in 1999 designed to be a pure step machine. It wasn't designed to support editing while playing because that wasn't the intended workflow of the program. Instead, the player stopped automatically when starting to edit, which is actually a very efficient way to work. However, after numerous requests, editing while playing was eventually possible. But, to avoid having to rewrite almost the whole program, the player was just paused when editing, which caused all playing notes to stop permanently. However, more and more functions have later been rewritten in such a way that the player does not have to pause while editing. There's still many functions left where the player is paused while editing though and that's the reason playing notes sometimes are silenced while editing. Hopefully, all these situations will be removed in the future. This is not the case for the sequencer though. The sequencer was built from the ground up to support editing while playing.
