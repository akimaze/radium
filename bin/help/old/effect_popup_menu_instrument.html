Sets value back to the initial value provided by the instrument.

<a name="midilearn"></a><h3>MIDI Learn</h3>

After selecting this option, immediately turn a knob on your MIDI device. The knob should now control this effect.

<p>
  
  To remove the MIDI controller, right-click again, and select "Remove MIDI learn" from the popup menu.
  To assign a different MIDI controller, right-click again, and select "MIDI relearn".

<p>

  Visit "MIDI" -> "MIDI Learn Configuration" in the main menus to configure all "MIDI Learn"-ed controllers:<br>

<p>
  
If it didn't work to assign a MIDI controller to this effect, make sure your MIDI device is added
under "Input ports" in the "MIDI" tab in the preferences window:<br>

<a name="assignmodulator"></a><h3>Assign Modulator</h3>

A modulator constantly changes the value of the effect, usually in a cyclic manner (<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-frequency_oscillation">LFO</A>). You change shape and frequency in the instrument widget of the modulator:

<p>
  Modulators are often used to create vibrato, tremolo, and so forth.
<p>
  

<a name="record"></a><h3>Start recording automation in editor</h3>

Lets you record automation:
<OL>
  <LI> Move the editor cursor to the track you want the automation
  <LI> Select "Start recording automation in editor"
  <LI> Play block (Press right shift)
  <LI> While playing, move the slider, or a MIDI controller that has <a href="#midilearn">learned</a> to control this slider.
  <LI> Stop playing.
  <LI> The recorded automation should now be placed in the current track.    
  <LI> To quantitize the newly recorded automation:
  <OL>
    <LI> Show <a href="fxtext_editor_framed">FX text</a> for the editor track
    <LI> Adjust <A href="lztrack_editor_framed.html">LZ</A> to the wanted resolution.
    <LI> Press <b>Left alt + Q</b>
  </OL>
</OL>

<p>

  After recording, a lot of automation nodes have often been created. Editing all these values can be inconvenient, so you might also want to quantitize the values afterwards:
  <OL>
    <LI> Enable "FX Text" in the editor track popup menu.
    <LI> Move cursor to the FX text subtrack.
    <LI> Adjust LZ to the resolution you want.
    <LI> Press Left Alt + Q to quantitize.
  </OL>

  To delete the automation, press Left Alt + X while the cursor is positioned in the FX text subtrack. (Or use undo.)

<p>
