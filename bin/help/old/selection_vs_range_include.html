<h3>Selection vs. range</h3>

There are two ways to select notes:
<OL>
  <LI> <b>Selection</b> in the pianoroll.
  <LI> <b>Ranged notes</b> in the <a href="notetext_editor_framed.html">note-text subtrack</A> (called <b>"range"</b>).
</OL>

If there is <b>no range</b> in the current block, all functions operating on a range will <b>instead</b> work on the <b>selected notes</b> in the current track.

    <p>
      
<h4>Differences between selection and range:</h4>
<UL>
  <LI>A range is all notes within the "range-rectangle" (spanning both lines and tracks), while
    a selection is all notes that has been selected.
  <LI>Selection and range <b>don't share</b> the same <b>clipboard buffer</b>.
  <LI>While <b>selection</b> operates on a track, a <b>range</b> operates on a block.
</UL>
