<h2>Instrument widget</h2>

                <UL>
                  <LI>The instrument widget contains several elements to control the sound. See tool tips for more information.
                  <LI>The term "Instrument" is used for all types of sound objects, for instance plugins, MIDI event manipulators, and sound buses.
                  <LI>The instrument widget is either positioned in:
                    <UL>
                      <LI>The lower tabs in the main window
                      <LI>The lower area of the mixer window
                    </UL>
                    Click the "I" button in the mixer to switch between these two positions.
                  <LI>By right-clicking a slider or checkbox, you can learn MIDI, assign an LFO, add automation, record into the editor, etc.
                  <LI>Enable <b>Sample Seek</b> or <b>MIDI chase</b> for an instrument by pressing the <b>"S"</b> button in the instrument header. Sample seek is only supported by the Sampler instrument. All other instruments will resort to MIDI chase when this option is enabled.
                  <LI> Some common instruments:
                    <UL>
                      <LI> <a onclick="showHide('sampler')" href="#!">Sample Player</a>
                        <div id="sampler" style="display: none">
                          The sample player plays audio files.
			  <UL>
			    <LI>The Sample Player can load XI intruments; Soundfonts, and all types of sample formats supported by libsndfile.
			    <LI>WAV files are looped if they have loops defined in the "sampl" chunk, or they have "Loop Start" and "Loop End" cue id's.
			    <LI>SoundFonts (.sf2 files) often sound better when played with the FluidSynth instrument instead of the Sample Player. However, the Sample Player uses less memory, are faster to create, has sample-accurate note scheduling, supports pitch changes and polyphonic aftertouch (velocity can be changed while a note is playing), and has configurable options such as attack, decay, sustain, and release.
			    <LI>There is currently no graphical sample editor to edit samples, a feature which traditionally are provided by trackers. This feature should be provided later though. Until then, external sample editors must be used instead, if needed.
			    <LI>To record audio, either from outside the program or inside the program, click the red <font color="red">Record</font> button in the instrument widget header. A new audio file will be created automatically when recording. Recording will start when the new instrument receives a note, and it will stop recording when that note stops playing.
			  </UL>
                        </div>
                      <LI> <a onclick="showHide('faustdev')" href="#!">FaustDev</a>
                        <div id="faustdev" style="display: none">
                          The Faust instrument lets you program <A href="http://faust.grame.fr">Faust</A> instruments in Radium. Also note that there is no "compile" button since programs are compiled in realtime while you write code.
                        </div>
                      <LI> <a onclick="showHide('puredata')" href="#!">Pure Data</a>
                        <div id="puredata" style="display: none">
                          The Pure Data instrument lets you program <A href="http://puredata.info">Pure Data</A> instruments in Radium. Currently, this instrument is only available on Linux.
