  <LI> To <b>prevent</b> radium from <b>automatically changing the current block</b> in the editor when the mouse pointer is above an editor seqblock, enable the padlock checkbox in the lower left corner of the editor:<br> <IMG SRC="force_current_block.png" ALT="Sequencer" style="border:10px solid transparent">.<br>
    Another way to enable this option is to right-click an editor seqblock and enable "Forced as current block".
